# Messaging-Forum
• Developed a locally Ubuntu-hosted web messaging interface using HTML, CSS, and PHP for customer account creation, private messaging, and theme selection.  
• Messaging interface connects to a MySQL database through MySQLi library that stores account information and messages.  
• Utilized AJAX to provide better user experience by showing new messages without refreshing by asynchronously updating the page.  

A local messaging website that connects to a backend PHP database.
I created this project in my Senior Year of Highschool, 2021, to practice using HTML, CSS, and PHP in one environment all together. Although it's only hosted locally, this was my first time working with all of these in one environment and I also learned AJAX and regular expressions along the way. 

What challenged me most was getting multiple programming languages to work together along with understanding how they all work together to make a functional messaging interface. Through this project, I have a clear understanding of how these programming langauges work together, rely on each other, and their pros and cons of using them.
